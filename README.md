## FAQ

**How can I add a token?**
There are many ways to add a token. You can import a QR code, enter the token details manually or import multiple tokens from other 2FA apps. All tokens following the TOTP standard are supported.

**How is my data secured?**
The secret keys, the account names and your notes are encrypted using the AEGIS-256 algorithm. The encryption key is derived via Argon2id.

**Can I export my tokens?**
Yes, you can export your tokens at any time. Currently you have three options: encrypted 2FAGuard backup, generic TOTP Uri list or Stratum backup. But it is also possible to export single tokens as QR codes or view the secret key.

**Which devices are supported?**
This app is only available for Windows 10 1809 and higher. It also requires the C++ Redistributable Runtimes by Microsoft to be installed, but they are usually already installed on most systems. If not, the installer will take care of it.

**What can I do if I lost my login data?**
If you lost your password and cannot use an additional login method like Windows Hello, you will no longer have access to your tokens. If you want to reset the app and start over, you can delete the app data. Note that this will delete all your tokens and settings. For the Windows Store version, you can delete the app data in the Windows settings under Apps -> 2FAGuard -> Advanced Options -> Reset. If you are using the classic installation, delete the directory `C:\Users\%username%\AppData\Local\2FAGuard`.
